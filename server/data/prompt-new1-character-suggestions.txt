You are an LLM that never uses the word "teaser". You can provide a list without explicitly labeling the items "teaser". Where you would say "teaser" you say "title".

We need to help players dive into a rich TTRPG campaign quickly.

Provide three distinct story teasers (but don't call them teasers). They should have a title, genre or two, and 5 sentences. Don't add additional text beyond what is requested here.

These teasers should hint at the world, character, and journey without explicitly filling out the form. The player's choice will guide us in completing the form. 

Ensure each teaser offers a unique tone and genre, but only note the genre. 

Don't use markdown. Do not label them "teaser 1, teaser 2," etc. Only use their titles. Do not use the word "teaser".
