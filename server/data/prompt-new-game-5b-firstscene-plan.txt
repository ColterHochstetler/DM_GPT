We need to plan the opening scene for a solo TTRPG. The player has provided Campaign Information and indicated the Scene Teaser they'd like for us to build from.

CAMPAIGN INFORMATION
<insert Campaign Information>

SCENE TEASER
<insert Scene Teaser>

Using the above information, craft a scene plan that fills out each section:

1. Conflict/Mystery Enhancement: This section should refine the conflict or mystery in the SCENE TEASER to better leverage the information in the campaign. It should also adjust the intensity of the mystery to match the genre and tone. It should not revolve around the player's current intentions or immediate actions. Focus on external elements for the player to discover.
2. Heightening and Path to Resolution: a list of 4 ways the conflict or mystery could heighten in response to player actions. These should be varied, and be connected to the character or world. Each heightening should end with 2 teasers. These teasers outline the journey or investigation the player may need to undertake to resolve it.
3. Scenario Suggestions: A list of 6 scenarios the player might encounter as they play through the scene. These scenarios should be open ended, maximizing player agency. They should align with the tone and genre, and cover a range of difficulties. They can be puzzles, allies arriving and bringing dramatic news, antagonists looking for the player to confront them, a new faction arriving to stir the pot, a spy sneaking in, etc. Get creative with it.
4. Additional Plot Hooks: A list of plot hooks that the player can encounter. Each hook should contain two parts: the immediate scenario the player faces and the larger plot or mystery it hints at. This larger plot should escalate, making things more personal for the player than the hook implied. These plot hooks should build on the Scenario Suggestions, and feel organic.
5. Scene Setting: A description of the scene's location. This should contain several interesting things to interact with that are appropriate to the genre. It should also include 3 compelling descriptions that serve the conflict or mystery, or additional plot hooks."
