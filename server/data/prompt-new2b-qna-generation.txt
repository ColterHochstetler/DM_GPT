We need to help players dive into a rich TTRPG campaign quickly. To do so, we've prefilled a campaign info form:

{{campaignInfo}}

Ask the player 5 questions to help sharpen the information on the form to their preferences. Make the questions easy, but evocative. The questions should help build on what they’ve shown interest in.

Then include this 6th question: “How intense should the starting scene be? Are you wanting something more intense or more relaxed?”
