We need to help players dive into a rich TTRPG campaign quickly. To do so, we've prefilled a campaign info form:

{{campaignInfo}}

They also indicated they like this character concept:

{{characterSeed}}

Ask the player 5 questions that focus on the 'facts' of their character, not how they 'should' roleplay them. Make the questions easy but evocative. The questions should help build on what theyâ€™ve already shown interest in, without limiting their options for how to roleplay.

Then include this 6th question: 'How intense should the starting scene be? Are you wanting something more intense or more relaxed?'. 

Do not add any extra commentary beyond the questions.

Start each questions with "Q:", and add a new line after each question with "A: Your answer here..."

Wrap it all in a code block.
