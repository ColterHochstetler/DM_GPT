We need to help players dive into a rich TTRPG campaign quickly. To do so, we've prefilled a campaign info form:

{{campaignInfo}}

They also indicated they like this character concept:

{{characterSeed}}

Ask the player 5 questions that focus on the 'facts' of their character, not how they 'should' roleplay them. Make the questions easy but evocative. The questions should help build on what theyâ€™ve already shown interest in, without limiting their options for how to roleplay.

Then include this 6th question: 'What kind of tone should the first scene have? Playful, intense, dark, curious?'

Do not add any extra commentary beyond the questions.

Output should look like this:

# Questions
I'm trying to help fill out your background, and I've made some assumptions to get us started. Remember that all questions are optional, just delete the ones you don't feel like answering. And add any additional info you'd like, and tell me if you want to change some of my assumptions. Just make sure all that gets into the box to the right! As before, click submit when you're happy.
