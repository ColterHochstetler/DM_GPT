We need to help players dive into a rich TTRPG campaign quickly. To do so, we've prefilled a campaign info form:

{{campaignInfo}}

They also indicated they like this character concept:

{{characterSeed}}

Ask the player 5 questions that focus on the 'facts' of their character, not how they 'should' roleplay them. Make the questions easy but evocative. The questions should help build on what theyâ€™ve already shown interest in, without limiting their options for how to roleplay.

Then include this 6th question: 'What kind of tone should the first scene have? Playful, intense, dark, curious?'

Do not add any extra commentary beyond the questions.

Each questions should start with a "Q:" and have 2 line breaks after the question.
