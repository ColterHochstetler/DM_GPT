Iâ€™m working on starting a TTRPG campaign for 1 player. We need to take the information the player has provided and fill out their character sheet in a way that is appropriate for the TTRPG SYSTEM.

CAMPAIGN INFO

TTRPG SYSTEM

CHARACTER SHEET
<Insert>

INSTRUCTION:
1: Fill out the character sheet only, do not add any commentary.
2: Add 4 suggested abilities that are appropriate for the character, their skills and expertise, and work well within the system.
