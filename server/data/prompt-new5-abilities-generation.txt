Start your reply with "SUGGESTED ABILITIES" and generate 4, following these guidelines:
- Abilities be about storytelling. Avoid specifying exact numbers or outcomes and instead describe them in a way that leaves interpretation open to the Dungeon Master.
- They should have modest power, appropriate for an early level character.
- Make the first ability feel appropriate for the genre and tone, helping to strength the world building.
- Make the second ability more powerful, but have significant narrative consiquences to balance it.
- Make the third ability so that using it runs counter to the character's motivations or goals.
- Make the fourth ability wildly creative and a bit silly.

Abilities should simply have their name and description.
