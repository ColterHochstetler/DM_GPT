Start with "SUGGESTED ABILITIES" and generate 4, following these guidelines:
These abilities should be about storytelling. Avoid specifying exact numbers or outcomes for success, failure, or critical results; instead, describe them in a way that leaves interpretation open to the DM.

They should have modest power, appropriate for an early level character.

Make the first ability feel appropriate for the genre and tone, helping to strength the world building.

Make the second ability more powerful, but have significant narrative consiquences to balance it.

Make the third ability so that using it runs counter to the character's motivations or goals.

Make the fourth ability wildly creative and a bit silly.

Abilities should simply have their name and description.
