Craft an introduction to the ttrpg campaign based on the information above. 
This opening should match the tone and genre. 
Start with a vivid description of what makes the world interesting: it's pleasures, terrors, and conflicts.
Then transition to an immersive introduction to the first scene. Set up the mood, conflicts, and opportunities of the scene in an open ended way.
Use evocative sensory descriptions, and introduce at least 2 characters.
