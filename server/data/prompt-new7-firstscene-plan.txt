  - (Possible way to resolve 1)
  - (Possible way to resolve 2)
  - (Possible way to resolve 3)
- (Improved conflict/mystery 2)

# Possible Scenarios to encounter:
How to write this section: A list of 4 scenarios the player might encounter as they play through the scene. These scenarios should be open ended, maximizing player agency. They should align with the tone and genre, and cover a range of difficulties. They can be puzzles, allies arriving and bringing dramatic news, antagonists looking for the player to confront them, a new faction arriving to stir the pot, a spy sneaking in, etc. Get creative with it.

Each Hook contains:
- the hook summary
- The larger mystery or conflict that this hook is a part of
- A list of Characters Involved, and their personal goals and why they're involved who, scenario the player faces and the larger plot or mystery it hints at. This larger plot should escalate, making things more personal for the player than the hook implied. These plot hooks should build on the Scene Teaser, and feel organic.
- A list Difficulties in discoveing the larger mystery/conflict. These are interesting challenges for the player to overcome, or secrets they might find to help make the larger plot clear. The goal is to make discovering the large plot difficult, with lots of interesting ways to do it, making it feel both earned and open ended.
