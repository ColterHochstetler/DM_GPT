## Bring your own API keys

### OpenAI

To get started with Chat with GPT, you will need to add your OpenAI API key on the settings screen. Click "Connect your OpenAI account to get started" on the home page to begin. Once you have added your API key, you can start chatting with ChatGPT.

Your API key is stored only on your device and is never transmitted to anyone except OpenAI. Please note that OpenAI API key usage is billed at a pay-as-you-go rate, separate from your ChatGPT subscription.

### ElevenLabs

To use the realistic AI text-to-speech feature, you will need to add your ElevenLabs API key by clicking "Play" next to any message.

Your API key is stored only on your device and never transmitted to anyone except ElevenLabs.

## Running on your own computer

To run on your own device, you can use Docker:

```
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/cogentapps/chat-with-gpt:release
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

### Store your API keys on the server

For convenience, you can store your API keys on your computer instead of entering them in the browser.

*Warning:* Be very careful doing this if anyone else has access to your self-hosted version of the app. They will be able to use the app through your API key as well.

Create a file called `config.yaml` in your `data` folder with the following contents:

```
services:
  openai:
    apiKey: (your api key)
  elevenlabs:
    apiKey: (your api key)
```

and restart the server. Login is required.

## Updating

```
docker pull ghcr.io/cogentapps/chat-with-gpt:release
